 **Learning Experience**
 At the start of the course I knew how to do basic models in Blender Bonsai from having the course OpenBIM. At the end of the course I knew how to actually read, process and adjust data in an IfcModel without even opening it, with a python script through github.
 Getting more familiar with Ifc - and Python too - would allow me to do just about anything in terms fo modelling through python scripts.

 **Process of developing the tutorial**
 No matter how much I decide to improve at OpenBIM usage later in my studies, the tools I've learnt in this course will allow me to caster read, edit and work with IfcModels for the rest of my studies and career.
 The amount of choice in the use cases was adequate.
 I think the scope of the course was a bit too broad and it would have been a better learning experience to spend a bit more time of the core focuses on the course and less on extra tools / concepts.

 **My future for Advanced use of OpenBIM**
 I will likely use OpenBIM in my thesis if a use case comes up. I do not plan on specializing specifically in OpenBIM use.
 I will likely use OpenBIM in my career if it will improve my efficiency.

 **Wrap up**
 I liked that A1-A5 were tied together and that the whole course felt like a project, while also learning a lot and applying concepts and tools throughout. 
 A3 was an interesting assignment, and while I'm happy with the outcome, due to my limited python experience it was challenging to make something too comprehensive.
 I liked the idea of A4, but it did feel a bit out of place.
 Overall the manager - anaylyst relationsships limits creativity, as managers need to be able to keep tabs on all projects. We "overdid" an early assignment and were asked to tone it down a bit so managers didn't have to do extra work.

**Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended**
At the beginning, I was definitely a self-learner, having been exposed to the concepts both at work and at university. However, this exposure was limited to some interactions with the concepts of ontology and Molio standards. Over the course, I feel I’ve moved closer to understanding the importance of having a "common language" in OpenBIM, even though I still don’t fully grasp all the standards and terms used.

**What else do you still need to learn?**
I need a deeper dive into the standards to better understand what fully utilizing the OpenBIM concept might entail. At the moment, I don’t think Bonsai is mature enough to be widely implemented in the Danish consulting industry, but the underlying concepts are excellent.

**How you might use OpenBIM in the future?**
I might use it in a work setting, as I already work extensively with FSD, which is close to being an open-source fire CFD program used for simulations in fire engineering. GitHub plays a significant role in this, and internally in our firm, a new standard for naming and BIM usage is being implemented. Some of the knowledge I’ve gained in this course could be useful in that context.

**Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for your thesis?**
There is potential to implement the idea of OpenBIM into developing a tool that automatically generates an FSD model from an OpenBIM model. This could be an area worth exploring further.

**Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?**
Yes, I would. I would also have preferred the difficulties to be higher. The course, as it stands, is simply too easy, and it feels like everyone is getting a free pass. I understand the intention behind creating an inclusive learning environment, but at a master’s level, it is reasonable to set standards that challenge and require students to develop themselves. A loose structure makes it easy to opt for the simplest solution, which doesn’t necessarily encourage outstanding performance.

**Was the number of tools for the course ok – should we have more or less? If so, which ones would you leave out?**
As mentioned, the course seems to have a very low threshold. I would have liked there to be more material to work through or at least clearer boundaries regarding what is required at different stages of the course. The course is too loosely structured, and I found it challenging to determine what was expected of me at any given time.
